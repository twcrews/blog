I’ve started reading Matt Walsh’s *Church of Cowards*, which serves as a heavy indictment of the state of modern American Christianity. At time of writing, I’ve only read the first two chapters. I already feel totally convicted; almost ashamed to declare my citizenship in the Kingdom. 

# TL;DR

If Paul were around today to write a letter to the church in America, it would probably look a lot like *Church of Cowards*. If you live in the U.S. and want a Colossians-like audit of your faith, this is the book for you. 

# Harsh Truths

Anyone who knows Walsh’s work is well aware he’s not one to shy away from controversial topics. This book is no exception. The *What Is a Woman* author gets straight to the point, calling out the Western church’s most egregious pitfalls in the first chapter. 

Without calling any by name, Matt gives typical examples of several denominational archetypes. He highlights the compromises—often, the outright rejections—made by each in an effort to appeal to Western culture. And there’s no slack given to the attendees, who are depicted as passive bystanders sipping Starbucks lattes in the church lobby. 

# Illusions of Persecution

In the second chapter, we’re drawn in stark contrast with Eastern Christians. A notable hypothetical compares underground Egyptian Christians with their American counterparts. The former, crossing the desert under cover of darkness to pray at a distant monetary, are held at gunpoint and told to renounce their faith in exchange for their lives. 

Meanwhile, we can’t be bothered to drive twelve minutes to church on Sunday morning. We won’t even risk missing the game, much less risk losing ourselves. We’re called to the mat in plain, familiar terms: the ones trying to save our lives. If we don’t wake up, we’ll lose them. 

# Time to Wake Up

I’m still at the beginning of this book, but my two brain cells are already in overdrive, forming prognoses and solutions. I’m sure Matt will give a much better insight, but I wanted to share mine anyway. Maybe we’ll overlap somewhere.

Scripture tells us that before Christ returns, there will be a great apostasy; a rebellion within the Church. If this happens in our era, I fear that we in the West may be best positioned to lead the charge. A large number of “Christian” churches already openly reject the Word (think topics like homosexuality, women's roles in the church, etc.), labeling it “outdated” or “misinterpreted.”

I’m reminded of Revelation’s message to the church in Sardis:

> I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead…If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you. ‭‭(Rev.‬ ‭3‬:‭1b, 3b ESV‬‬)

# Contemporary Challenges

Matt chides us—rightfully—for the idea that the American church is threatened with persecution. And he’s right; it’s silly to compare our situation with that of Christians facing torture and death in other parts of the world. But I have a different take. We are indeed facing a form of spiritual persecution. Ours is more subtle, but just as dangerous. 

The modern Western man has everything he needs, everything he could ever want. Worse, he has all that *without* God. Just as the Eastern Christian’s prerogative is to carry his cross in spite of the dangers he faces, ours is the same in spite of the comforts that tempt us. 

Our challenge is to reject the classic deal with the devil. Walk away from the comfortable life, promised us if only we keep our heads down and fall in line. Say “no” and proudly give it up for the One who gave up everything. It’s a tall order, to be sure; it’s one I struggle with every day. 

# In Conclusion

I’m excited to finish this book. We’re surrounded by so much affirmation in our society that it’s actually refreshing to have my lifestyle and faith challenged. How much are we willing to give up for the Kingdom? Everything?

Anything?
