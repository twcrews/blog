*Agile Development* is the buzzword (buzzphrase?) of our time. It's universally self-attributed by modern development teams, although true adherance to its namesake manifesto seems scanty at best.

# TL;DR

When possible, *always* release code more often, even if it means less code gets released over time. This will give you more feedback and more opportunity to react to changing requirements. It might even make it easier to estimate your velocity.

# Frequency Always Beats Quantity

There's no shortage of opinions about what agile development looks like in terms of project management. Today, I'm adding one of my own to the pile: one feature delivered each week is preferable to ten features delivered each month.

In fact, I think this idea can be boiled all the way down to its functional elements. A higher delivery rate is *virtually always* better than a higher delivery volume, regardless of the disparity. One feature each week is better than *a hundred* each month.

# The Importance of Feedback

Devs are generally left-brained people. We love things that can be measured, quantified, analyzed, organized. Information in the elementary, tangible sense. We shy away from the qualitative; the abstract; the ephereal. And I think we do so at our own detriment.

Feedback is a mostly immeasurable resource. It's subjective. It's ever-changing. It's unpredictable. In the worst cases, it's demoralizing and even depressing. Nobody wants their hard work torn to shreads by their audience.

But feedback is also indespensible. Wielded properly, it's an engineer's most effective tool. My stance on frequency over volume—at all costs—rests on the criticality of feedback (pun definitelty intended). Specifically, it's a result of my strong belief in true agility: the ability to react quickly to changing requirements.

# A Hypothetical Scenario

If you're still skeptical, ask yourself a hypothetical question. You're a business owner, and you want to release a new product family to your customers. The dev team presents two potential release strategies. Which is preferable? 

Option 1: You can wait a year, after which you'll receive a complete product. Changes can be made, but it might be another year before the updated product is released, with all the requested changes lumped in together.

Option 2: The product won't be complete for an estimated five years, but you receive working code—features your customers can use, even if the product isn't complete—*every single week*. As requirements change, code changes can be deployed on the same cadence.

# A Thought on Velocity

I mentioned that devs love the quantifiable. In our world, we generally measure our productivity by our velocity. To effectively estimate time needed for a project, you need to have a good estimate of your velocity. And estimating velocity is hard.

More frequent code releases can make it easier. As you push features more often, you actually have a *higher resolution* view of your velocity. So even if your time estimates aren't completely accurate, they'll be much more precise. There's an argument to be made that the latter is more important; but that's for another post.

# In Conclusion

Every rule has its exceptions, and this rule is no exception. Even I understand that every project and scenario is unique. There's more than one way to ~~skin~~ pet a cat, and ultimately, you'll have to decide what balance works for your team. Just remember: if you don't do what I think is right, you're wrong.
